# CodeforcesSols
Adding solutions to Codeforces Problems as I solve them; I've only just started and this is by no means a completed list

\timeLimitExceed contains script that seem to have the idea right but are too slow to be accepted; I will probably end up rewriting them in some other langauge, probably C++ or Rust. Note: as of this commit, all scripts in the folder have been converted to a C++ script.  

Scripts are mostly written in Python 3 since that's what I'm most familiar with but some are done with C++ because it's MUCH faster; file names correspond to the question number on Codeforces

I'm still fairly new (and as a result, bad) to competitive programming so most of the problems that I am able to solve are fairly trivial but as Jake the Dog points out, "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
