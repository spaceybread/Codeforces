# CodeforcesSols
Adding solutions to Codeforces Problems as I solve them; I've only just started and this is by no means a completed list

\timeLimitExceed contains script that seem to have the idea right but are too slow to be accepted; I will probably end up rewriting them in some other langauge, probably C++ or Rust

Scripts are written in Python 3 since that's what I'm most familiar with; file names correspond to the question number on Codeforces
